We met before as a group with Harry, Ricco and Jeremy earlier in the week so there was not much new.

We all struggled to understand how spack and cmake are related. I was also confused about make vs. cmake, and wondered if learning to create cmake files was a bridge to far.

We thought the expectation was that we would actually create a CMake build file. And we were trying to understand why we would do that vs. just downloading the prebuild file using spack (which lets you customize what version of the build you get).

I really struggled because the first lecture had about 1 hour devote to the CMake build of pytorch. And then there was about 1 – 1.5 hours in the second lecture also about this. I took notes but they were not that great because I kept flipping back and forth between my google doc (notes) vs the live coding presentation.

I think what we really needed was list of the steps needed to build pytorch using CMake. This would be a lot easier to follow at a high level vs. trying to piece that information together from 2.5 hours of video! I think the steps were NOT that complicated. I just think video is not always the best way to teach these sorts of things. You really need a step by step guide too so that you can follow it.

I also think there should be some diagrams explaining what you are doing. This class is so code heavy. I am an architect and I normally distill everything into diagrams that show the relevant information and related the components of any solution, or show the steps in a process, etc. Video is just too heavy for doing this.

I did better in the prior labs because you recorded the scripts for what you were doing. So I could quickly scan that. There were no files at all for this CMake in class exercise – just the videos. 

During the class we just talked briefly – nothing new.
